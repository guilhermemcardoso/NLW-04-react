## Introduction

The project is based on the Pomodoro technique and integrates it with a list of exercises that you can practice during your intervals.

The list of exercises contains exercises for your body and your eyes because the main goal is helping people that stays a lot of your in front of a computer screen.

This project was developed during the Next Level Week 04, idealized by [Rocketseat](https://github.com/rocketseat). I thank all those responsible for creating the event. It was incredible.
